## React.js demo
- Lesson 1 implements a simple web app using HTML markup and JavaScript.
- Lesson 2 converts the HTML markup in Lesson 1 using JavaScript's DOM API.
- Lesson 3 is a React app that parallels the JavaScript from Lesson 2.
- Lesson 4 converts the React DOM API of Lesson 3 to JSX, paralleling the HTML
  markup of Lesson 1.

Lessons 3 and 4 were created with [Facebook's Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The following commands must be installed to run them:
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)  (v10.4.1)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) (v1.7.0)
- [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) (5.10.0)

To install dependencies for, e.g., Lesson 3, run:
```
cd lesson3
yarn install
```

After its dependencies are installed, run Lesson 3 using:
```
yarn start
```
